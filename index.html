<p class="ha">Early this morning, a louce who goes by the name "Ronny the G", was seen completing complex math questions in a local Costa. Residents of the town rushed to the scene, to find a tiny little     
loucy boi, with glasses and a cup of black coffee. Startled by this, the police were called and arrived on scene at around 11:45 this morning. The police now have Ronny the G in custody, and 
are conducting risk assesments to see if he may be part of a terrorist organisation.

<br><br>

Upon questioning, Ronny exlaimed that he had no alterior motive, he was simply a lil guy enjoying a brew. 
He feels as though his arrest is a 'violation' and 'discrimintary', as he feels as though he was targeted with no solid lawful reasoning. He explained he is a simple scottish guy, and said 
"I feel pro'er unappy abowt all o des shyt! Ets focking bollshet!" before breaking out into a song about being "just a wee lad on his way to work". He proclaimed this was very dissapointing,
as he was very excited to come to England, but now feels like "another rightly geezer thrown in with the wonky spuds".</p>

<br><br>

 Since the incident, supports of Ronny the G have started protesting against the mistreatment of woodlouce in England, and have gained support from all across the globe. <br><br>
